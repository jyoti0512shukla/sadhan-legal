# Privacy Policy

**Sadhana — A Way of Life**
*Last updated: February 9, 2026*

## Introduction

Sadhana ("the App") is a Hindu spiritual practice app developed as a personal devotional companion. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores the following data **exclusively on your device**. This data is never transmitted to our servers or any third party:

- **Spiritual practice data**: Japa session counts, reading progress, streaks, and milestones
- **Personal reflections**: Daily journal entries you create within the App
- **Preferences**: Tab order, selected mantras, Panchang location, ambient sound settings, and other customization choices
- **Bookmarks and reading plans**: Your saved positions and active reading plans

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- We do **not** require account creation or sign-in
- We do **not** track your location (the Panchang location setting is a manual preference stored locally)
- We do **not** use analytics, advertising SDKs, or third-party tracking tools
- We do **not** store any data on remote servers

### Device Permissions

The App may request the following device permissions, each used solely for the stated purpose:

| Permission | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Microphone** | Aarti sing-along feature — listens to your singing to highlight the current lyric line. Audio is processed on-device and is never recorded or transmitted. |
| **Speech Recognition** | Recognizes aarti lyrics being sung to follow along with the text. Processing occurs on-device via Apple's Speech framework. |
| **Photo Library (Save Only)** | Allows you to save verse cards as images to your photo library for sharing. The App does not read or access your existing photos. |

You may deny any of these permissions, and the App will continue to function — only the specific feature requiring that permission will be unavailable.

### Network Usage

The App may connect to the internet solely to:

- Download optional scripture content packs (e.g., Bhagavad Gita, Vedas) from public repositories
- Fetch the Chalisa catalog for display

No personal data is transmitted during these requests. The App functions fully offline for all bundled content.

## Data Security

All your data is stored locally on your device using Apple's standard frameworks (SwiftData / Core Data). The data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including device passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID. We have no access to your data.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- **You control your data entirely.** Deleting the App removes all associated data from your device.
- There is no cloud backup of App data unless you have enabled iCloud device backups through your own Apple ID settings.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since the App collects no personal information from any user, it is safe for use by individuals of all ages.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The App does not share data with any third party.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

# Content Disclaimer & Terms of Use

## Content Accuracy

The spiritual, religious, and scriptural content provided in the Sadhana app — including but not limited to shlokas, mantras, aarti lyrics, chalisa texts, puja instructions, stotra, Panchang/tithi data, and translations — is offered **for informational and devotional purposes only**.

While we strive to present content that is faithful to traditional sources, **we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or correctness** of any content in the App. Variations in scripture texts, transliterations, translations, and interpretations are common across different traditions, regions, and scholarly sources.

Specifically:

- **Sanskrit/Devanagari texts** may contain typographical variations compared to specific printed editions
- **Transliterations** follow common romanization conventions but may differ from other systems (IAST, Harvard-Kyoto, etc.)

- **Panchang and tithi data** is computed/sourced for general reference and may differ from your local pandit's calculations or regional panchangs
- **Puja instructions** are generalized guides and should not be considered a substitute for guidance from a qualified priest or guru

## No Professional or Religious Authority

The App does not claim to be a religious authority. Content is curated from publicly available traditional texts and common devotional practices. The App is not affiliated with any specific temple, religious organization, sampradaya, or spiritual lineage.

Users are encouraged to consult qualified religious scholars, pandits, or their own guru for authoritative guidance on spiritual practices, rituals, and scripture interpretation.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

1. **No warranties**: The App and all its content are provided **"as is"** and **"as available"**, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, completeness, reliability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

   - Any offense, hurt sentiment, or disagreement arising from the presentation, translation, or interpretation of religious or scriptural content
   - Any reliance on Panchang data, tithi calculations, muhurat timings, or fasting guidelines

3. **No legal claims for content**: By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that **no legal challenge, lawsuit, or claim** may be brought against the developers or distributors of the App based on the religious or spiritual content provided. The content is offered in good faith as a devotional aid and is not intended to offend, misrepresent, or disrespect any tradition, deity, community, or individual.

4. **Indemnification**: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developers and distributors of the App from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App or any dispute related to its content.

## Intellectual Property

- Aarti and chalisa lyrics are traditional devotional compositions in the public domain
- App design, code, and curation are the intellectual property of the App's developers
